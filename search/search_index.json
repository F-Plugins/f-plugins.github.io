Using this plugin, players can add code locks to doors and storages - providing access to anyone who knows the code. Usage Simply lock a door/storage using the /lock <code> command. From here, other players can walk up to the object and attempt to use it. A keypad will pop up prompting for the code. Clicking anywhere on the screen except the keypad will close it. By default, each incorrect attempt will deal a bit more damage each time, until the player is killed. Commands /lock <code> - Adds a code lock to an object, or changes if one already exists. /unlock - Removes the code lock from an object. Permissions OpenMod Grant access to the /lock command: CodeLocks:commands.lock Grant access to the /unlock command: CodeLocks:commands.unlock Grant the ability to lock/unlock any lockable object CodeLocks:bypass Rocket Grant access to the /lock command: lock Grant access to the /unlock command: unlock Grant the ability to lock/unlock any lockable object bypasslock Configuration Effects - Effect IDs used by the plugin.

How about jump higher with certain guns? Features With Movement Modifier, you can change players' speeds, gravities, jump heights, and stamina costs based on which items are in their inventory or are equipped. This plugin is Rocket-reloadable , allowing on-the-fly changes to its simple configuration. Rather than running every frame, this plugin uses events to ensure zero lag caused by this plugin. Configuration The configuration has two main sections: Global Modifiers - applied to everyone Item Modifiers - applied when conditions are met All movement modifications in the configuration are based on multipliers. Examples: Specifying 2 as a jump modifier will allow the player to jump twice as high. Specifying 0.5 as a speed modifier will half the player's speed. By default, all clothing items, guns, melee weapons, tools, and clouds (umbrellas) must be equipped. This can be overrided by stating MustBeEquipped=\"False\" . The ID for item modifiers can either be the item name or item ID. If the ID is a number, it will first search for a matching item ID then a name if no item is found. Explanation of default config: When a player has a Viper equipped, they will run, jump, and fall twice as fast. When a player has the Tracksuit Top equipped, they will fall half as fast.

Using this plugin, players can buy and sell items and vehicles in your server's shop easily! Easily migrate from your existing ZaupShops installation using the migration command. See more in the Migration section. Usage Players can simply use /shop (or /vshop to directly access the vehicle shop). See the media on this page to view an example of the UI. At the moment, commands must be used to configure the shop. More info on configuring the shops can be found in the Commands section. Shop whitelists/blacklists are supported. The permission you specify in the commands for setup are not exact however. If you put eaglefire as the whitelist permission, the actual permission would be ShopsUI:groups.eaglefire . The permission you specify has ShopsUI:groups. added to the front. Migration If you wish to migrate from ZaupShops, you can simply run the command /shop migrate . If you used whitelists and blacklists with ZaupShop, you must also change some of your permissions. All existing permissions starting with zaupgroups. must be changed to start with ShopsUI:groups. . For example, the following permissions show their original and their migrated permissions: zaupgroup.epicguns \u2192 ShopsUI:groups.epicguns zaupgroup.vip \u2192 ShopsUI:groups.vip zaupgroup.mvp \u2192 ShopsUI:groups.mvp Commands Commands for UI: /shop - Opens the shop UI. /vshop - Opens the shop UI directly to the vehicle tab. Commands for shop management: Basic commands: /shop add <buy | sell> <item> <price> - Adds the item to the shop to be bought or sold. /shop remove <buy | sell> <item> - Removes the buyable/sellable item from the shop. /vshop add <vehicle> <price> - Adds the vehicle to the shop to be bought. /vshop remove <vehicle> - Removes the buyable vehicle from the shop. /shop reload - Reloads the shops from the database. /sellbox - Opens a virtual storage for selling items. UI-related management commands: /shop order <item> <order> - Sets the order of items in the shop UI. /vshop order <vehicles> <order> - Sets the order of vehicles in the shop UI.

Sellbox The /sellbox command feature allows players to quickly sell items by placing them in a virtual storage. The default sellbox size is configurable in the config.yaml file.
